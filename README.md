## Status Codes

| Status Name | Status Code | Status Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Success | 200 | The request succeeded. The actual response will depend on the request method used. |
| Created | 201 | The request was fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created. |
| Bad Request | 400 | The request could not be understood by the server due to incorrect syntax. |
| Unauthorized | 401 | The request requires user authentication. |
| Forbidden | 403 | The server received and understood the request, but will not fulfill it. Authorization will not help and the request MUST NOT be repeated. |
| Not Found | 404 | The server did not find anything that matches the Request-URI. No indication is given of whether the condition is temporary or permanent. |
| Conflict | 409 | The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource. |
