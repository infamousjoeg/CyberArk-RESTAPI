The actual response will depend on the request method used. |\n| Created | 201 | The request was fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created. |\n| Bad Request | 400 | The request could not be understood by the server due to incorrect syntax. |\n| Unauthorized | 401 | The request requires user authentication. |\n| Forbidden | 403 | The server received and understood the request, but will not fulfill it. Authorization will not help and the request MUST NOT be repeated. |\n| Not Found | 404 | The server did not find anything that matches the Request-URI. No indication is given of whether the condition is temporary or permanent. |\n| Conflict | 409 | The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource. |\n| Internal Server Error | 500 | The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request. |\n\n_NOTE: If you are having issues with DEL or PUT methods, make sure that your Password Vault Web Access (PVWA) Server's IIS instance does not include WebDav Publishing. This will cause known issues._"

        This method updates an existing account's details. It is not mandatory to send all the account’s details. Any changed values sent in the request will be updated. All other properties values will remain the same.


        On each property, the following operations can be performed:


        * Replace - replace the existing value of a property

        * Remove (to remove the property from the account)

        * Add (to add that property to the account)


        It is possible to set several properties using the same command using the following structure:


        ```json

        [
        	{
        	    "op": "replace",
        	    "path": "/platformaccountproperties",
        	    "value": "{
        	        \"{PropertyID1}\":\"{Value}\",
        	        \"{PropertyID2}\":\"{Value}\",
        	        \"{PropertyID3}\":\"{Value}\"
        	    }"
        	}
        ]

        ```


        When sending several operations on the same property, only the last operation will affect the property.

        This method updates an existing account's details. It is not mandatory to send all the account’s details. Any changed values sent in the request will be updated. All other properties values will remain the same.


        On each property, the following operations can be performed:


        * Replace - replace the existing value of a property

        * Remove (to remove the property from the account)

        * Add (to add that property to the account)


        It is possible to set several properties using the same command using the following structure:


        ```json

        [
        	{
        	    "op": "replace",
        	    "path": "/platformaccountproperties",
        	    "value": "{
        	        \"{PropertyID1}\":\"{Value}\",
        	        \"{PropertyID2}\":\"{Value}\",
        	        \"{PropertyID3}\":\"{Value}\"
        	    }"
        	}
        ]

        ```


        When sending several operations on the same property, only the last operation will affect the property.

    post:
      description: >-
        Shared authentication is based on a user credential file that is stored in the PVWA web server. During shared authentication, only the user defined in the credential file can log on to the PVWA, but multiple users can use the logon token.


        This type of authentication **requires** the application using the REST services to manage the users as the Vault can't identify which specific user performs each action.


        Multiple concurrent connections can be created using the same token, without affecting each other.


        The shared user is defined in a user credential file, whose location is specified in the WSCredentialFile parameter, in the appsettings section of the PVWAweb.config file:


        ```

        <add key="WSCredentialFile" value="C:\CyberArk\Password Vault Web Access\CredFiles\WSUser.ini"/>

        ```


        * Make sure that this user can access the PVWA interface.

        * Make sure the user only has the permissions in the Vault that they require.


        For information about securing communication when using the SDK, refer to the following:


        * [Securing application-to-REST communication](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/PAS/Latest/en/Content/SDK/Securing%20Communication.htm)

        * [Configuring client authentication via certificates](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/PAS/Latest/en/Content/SDK/Configuring%20Client%20Authentication%20via%20Client%20Certificates.htm)


        This method authenticates to the Vault with a shared webservices user and returns a token that will be used in subsequent web services calls.


        This is supported for CyberArk authentication only, and not for third party authentication.

        Passwords are stored in the Conjur database using bcrypt with a work factor of 12. Therefore, login is a fairly expensive operation. However, once the API key is obtained, it may be used to inexpensively obtain access tokens by calling the Authenticate method. An access token is required to use most other parts of the Conjur API.


        Your HTTP/REST client probably provides HTTP basic authentication support. For example, curl and all of the Conjur client libraries provide this.


        Note that machine roles (Hosts) do not have passwords and do not need to login.

      description: >-
        Gets a short-lived access token, which can be used to authenticate requests to (most of) the rest of the Conjur API. A client can obtain an access token by presenting a valid login name and API key.


        The login must be URL encoded. For example, `alice@devops` must be encoded as `alice%40devops`.


        For host authentication, the login is the host ID with the prefix `host/`. For example, the host webserver would login as `host/webserver`, and would be encoded as `host%2Fwebserver`.


        For API usage, the access token is ordinarily passed as an HTTP Authorization “Token” header.

    post:
      description: >-
        Gets a short-lived access token, which is required in the header of most subsequent API requests. A client can obtain an access token by presenting a valid login name and API key.


        The access token is used to communicate to the REST API that the bearer of the token has been authorized to access the API and perform specific actions specified by the scope that was granted during authorization.


        The login must be [URL encoded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/percent-encoding). For example, `alice@devops` must be encoded as `alice@devops`.


        The login is the host ID with the prefix `host/`. For example, the host `webserver` would log in as `host/webserver`, and would be encoded as `host/webserver`.


        ### Note


        Access tokens expire after 8 minutes. You need to obtain a new token after it expires.

        This method adds a new onboarding rule to the Vault that filters discovered local privileged pending accounts. When a discovered pending account matches a rule, it will automatically be onboarded to the Safe that is defined in the rule and the password will be reconciled.

        Note: The Safe and the reconcile account must be created according to the rule’s definition before you run this API in order to onboard the pending account automatically. The reconcile account must be associated to the platform that is defined in the rule.

        2. After you change the password, encode the user (**monitor**) and the new password in BASE 64.

        * Must have **Audit users** permissions in the Safe.

        * Can see groups either **only** on the **same** level, or **lower** in the Vault hierarchy.


        This depends on the HideVaultUsersTree parameter defined in the dbparam.ini. If HideVaultUsersTree is set to **No**, all groups will be returned (not only those in the same level or lower in the Vault hierarchy). If this parameter is set to **Yes**, only auditors and managers will be allowed to get all groups.
         	
        **Note:**

        * Filtering for this task is supported only from Vault v10.5.

        * Retrieving more than 1,000 groups may cause a slowdown in response.

      description: "Some mechanisms require the user to interact with a system outside of  \nyour client. These are known as out-of-band (OOB) mechanisms.\n\nOnce the user has chosen an OOB mechanism, call `/Security/AdvanceAuthentication` with the `Action` set to `StartOOB`. This officially begins the waiting period in which the user must either approve the request or provide a code.\n\nWhile you wait for the user to take action, perform a \"short poll\" on `/Security/AdvanceAuthentication`. You build the poll request by simply changing the original request's `Action` from `StartOOB` to `Poll`.\n\nFor example, you would initiate an OOB mechanism using:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"Action\": \"StartOOB\",\n    \"TenantId\": \"ABC1234\",\n    \"SessionId\": \"3RrrrhXFcUS3UEvl-3wfgMYojGz44P76Or2Ym3zztyM1\",\n    \"MechanismId\": \"bFxWVmtoBTV_h4C26UVfMzOGJa94zHxOqoEG_XrjZE81\"\n}\n\n```\n\nAfter you receive a `Success` response, you would then immediately begin polling with:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"Action\": \"Poll\",\n    \"TenantId\": \"ABC1234\",\n    \"SessionId\": \"3RrrrhXFcUS3UEvl-3wfgMYojGz44P76Or2Ym3zztyM1\",\n    \"MechanismId\": \"bFxWVmtoBTV_h4C26UVfMzOGJa94zHxOqoEG_XrjZE81\"\n}\n\n```\n\nSend this request once every second until the response `Summary` changes from `OobPending` to either `StartNextChallenge` or `LoginSuccess`."

                *   count: total count of returned resources. (**NOTE: Pagination is currently not working for Groups)**
            *   Example: Return users 10 through 13 using index.
                *   `GET https://myTenantUrl/scim/v2/Groups?startIndex=10&count=5`
        *   **Sort:**
            *   Returns all resources sorted either ascending (default) or descending based on a resource attribute.
                *   sortBy: resource attribute to sort by.
                *   sortOrder: ascending (default) or descending.
            *   Example: Return Groups sorted by *displayName* in *ascending* order.
                *   `GET https://myTenantUrl/scim/v2/Groups?sortBy=displayName&sortOrder=ascending`
        *   **Filter:**
            *   Returns a single resource specified by the filter in the response.
            *   Example: Return a single Group based on the *displayName* filter.
                *   `GET https://myTenantUrl/scim/v2/Groups?filter=displayName eq "myGroupName"`
        *   **Attributes:**
            *   Returns only the specified attributes in the JSON response.

        #### **Get Group By Group Id**


        **Requirements:** ***Requires CyberArk Password Vault Web Access (PVWA) version 12.2+***


        `GET https://myTenantUrl/scim/v2/Groups/{{id}}`


        Each Group object has a unique Group Id (attribute id) generated by the SCIM server, which you can find in the response payload of a GET request to [https://myTenantUrl.scim/v2/Groups](https://myTenantUrl.scim/v2/Groups). Adding the id attribute value to the Groups endpoint retrieves attributes for just that Group.


        #### Permissions Required


        *   User Rights
            *   Audit Users

        #### Query Parameters


        *   **Attributes:**
            *   Returns only the specified attributes in the JSON response.
            *   Example: Return Group 8 with only the *displayName* attribute.
                *   `GET https://myTenantUrl/scim/v2/Groups/8&attributes=displayName`

        DELETE one group deletes a group. The request uses a group ID to locate the group's endpoint. DELETE one group is the only request that returns no information in the HTTP response body. Requesting DELETE twice will yield an error, since the group ID no longer exists.


        Deleting a group will not delete the users involved, but will delete the connections the users have to the nonexistent group.

        This section defines a way to specify the schema in use by resources available and accepted by a SCIM service provider. For each "schemas" URI value, this schema specifies the defined attribute(s) and their characteristics (mutability, returnability, etc). For every schema URI used in a resource object, there is a corresponding "Schema" resource. "Schema" resources are not modifiable, and their associated attributes have a mutability of "readOnly". Except for "id" (which is always returned), all attributes have a "returned" characteristic of "default". Unless otherwise specified, all schema attributes are case insensitive. These resources have a "schemas" attribute with the following schema URI:


        > urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Schema


        Unlike other core resources, the "Schema" resource MAY contain a complex object within a sub-attribute, and all attributes are REQUIRED unless otherwise specified.


        A GET request to the /scim/v2/Schemas endpoint returns attributes for all objects.

        The DELETE request deletes a single user specified in the SCIM URL. You can only delete a single user. Trying to delete all users results in an error.


        DELETE is the only request that does not return a response. Running DELETE twice receives an error; you cannot delete a user if the user ID no longer exists in Vault.


        **Valid Examples:**


        Delete user with User Id = 1:

    This section includes three methods that enable you to perform a bulk upload of multiple accounts, and review the results.


    First, to add multiple accounts at one time to the system, use the Create bulk upload of accounts REST API.


    Next, to check the status of all the bulk account uploads that were performed by a user, use the Get all bulk account uploads for user REST API.


    Last, to review a summary of uploaded accounts and accounts that failed for a specific bulk upload, use the Get bulk account upload result REST API.

  description: >-
    This section includes REST APIs for configuring and managing OpenID Connect (OIDC) Identity Providers.


    The APIs are used to configure a provider in PVWA.


    These APIs must be used with the Authentication methods APIs in order to have a complete authentication configuration.


    For example, when you add or delete a provider, you must also add the provider to the list of authentication methods, or delete the provider from the list, using the same ID.
- name: Authentication Methods Config
  description: This section includes REST APIs for configuring and managing authentication methods.
- name: PKI Authentication
- name: SAML Authentication
- name: Shared Logon Authentication
  description: >-
    Shared authentication is based on a user credential file that is stored in the PVWA web server. During shared authentication, only the user defined in the credential file can log on to the PVWA, but multiple users can use the logon token.


    This type of authentication **requires** the application using the REST services to manage the users as the Vault can't identify which specific user performs each action.


    Multiple concurrent connections can be created using the same token, without affecting each other.


    The shared user is defined in a user credential file, whose location is specified in the WSCredentialFile parameter, in the appsettings section of the PVWAweb.config file:
      	

    ```

    <add key="WSCredentialFile" value="C:\CyberArk\Password Vault Web Access\CredFiles\WSUser.ini"/>

    ```


    * Make sure that this user can access the PVWA interface.

    * Make sure the user only has the permissions in the Vault that they require.

- name: Central Credential Provider (CCP)
- name: Out-of-Band Authentication
  description: >-
    Some mechanisms require the user to interact with a system outside of your client. These are known as out-of-band (OOB) mechanisms.


    Once the user has chosen an OOB mechanism, call `/Security/AdvanceAuthentication` with the `Action` set to `StartOOB`. This officially begins the waiting period in which the user must either approve the request or provide a code.


    While you wait for the user to take action, perform a "short poll" on `/Security/AdvanceAuthentication`. You build the poll request by simply changing the original request's `Action` from `StartOOB` to `Poll`.

To address use cases which need management of additional custom attributes for user objects that are not part of the SCIM User core schema, the CyberArk Identity SCIM server provides support for the custom schema (urn:scim:schemas:extension:custom:2.0).\n\nIn addition, CyberArk Identity supports attributes defined by the LinkedObject schema. These attributes are available only through GET requests - you can't modify them. Refer to [https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-grizzle-scim-pam-ext-01.html#linked-object](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-grizzle-scim-pam-ext-01.html#linked-object) for more information.\n\nFor testing the above methods, you need to send a header with a bearer token for authentication (retrieved through Actions in your SCIM App Settings) and a tenant ID for navigating to the correct endpoint. When you update User attributes using the Users/ endpoint, be sure to specify the schema in the request payload.\n\nThe following should be included in any request to the \"Users\" endpoint:  \n`\"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User\" ],`\n\n### **User Attributes**\n\n| **Attribute** | **Description** | **Data Type** | **Filter?** | **Sort By?** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| userName | User Name | String | Supported (1) | Supported |\n| displayName | User Display Name | String | Supported | Supported |\n| userType | System User Type (e.g. BuiltIn-Admins, EPVUser, etc..) | String | Supported | Supported |\n| active | User Enabled or Disabled | Boolean | Supported | Supported |\n| **groups** | Groups that user is a member of. | Array Complex | \\- | \\- |\n| *.type* | Groups Sub Attribute - Group Type (e.g. Vault or LDAP) | String | Supported | Not Supported |\n| *.display* | Groups Sub Attribute - Group Display Name | String | Supported | Not Supported |\n| *.value* | Groups Sub Attribute - Group Id | String | Supported | Not Supported |\n| *.$ref* | Groups Sub Attribute - Group Endpoint URL | String | Supported (2) | Not Supported |\n| **name** | User Name Fields | Complex | \\- | \\- |\n| *.givenName* | Name Sub Attribute - First Name | String | Supported | Supported |\n| *.middleName* | Name Sub Attribute - Middle Name | String | Supported | Supported |\n| *.familyName* | Name Sub Attribute - Last Name | String | Supported | Supported |\n| *.formatted* | Name Sub Attribute - Formatted Name | String | Supported | Supported |\n| entitlements | User's entitlements | Array | Not Supported | Not Supported |\n| id | Unique User Id | String | Supported | Not Supported |\n| schemas | User Schemas | Array | Not Supported | Not Supported |\n| meta | User Metadata | Complex | \\- | \\- |\n| *.resourceType* | Static - \"User\" | String | Supported | Supported |\n| *meta.created* | Date Created - YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.######Z | String | Not Supported | Supported |\n| *.lastModified* | Date Last Modified - YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.######Z | String | Not Supported | Supported |\n| *.location* | Resource Location URL | String | Supported | Supported |\n| **urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:cyberark:1.0:User** | Core User Information | Complex | \\- | \\- |\n| *.directoryType* | User Sub Attribute - (e.g Vault) | string | Not Supported | Not Supported |\n| **urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:pam:1.0:LinkedObject** | Contains External Directory Information | Complex | \\- | \\- |\n| *.source* | LinkedObject Sub Attribute - User Source (e.g. LDAP) | String | Not Supported | Not Supported |\n| *.nativeIdentifier* | LinkedObject Sub Attirbute - User Native Identifier (e.g. CN=xyz,dc=abc,dc=com) | String | Not Supported | Not Supported |\n| **urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User** | Contains Enterprise User Information | Complex | \\- | \\- |\n| *.organization* | Enterprise User Sub Attribute - Organization | String | Not Supported | Not Supported |\n| *.department* | Enterprise User Sub Attribute - Department | String | Not Supported | Not Supported |\n\n#### Notes\n\n*   *(1) Case Sensitive*\n*   *(2) You should enclose the attribute path in quotes to avoid Url encoding issues (e.g. \"groups.$ref\")*\n    \n\n### **Custom schema requirements**\n\nNote the following pre-requisites for using the custom SCIM schema.\n\n*   The SCIM schema must be specified in the request payload."

It's also difficult, if not impossible, for security admin to enforce a unified security standard across the organization.\n\nAnother obstacle to centralized secret management is that application owners developers prefer to work natively, without having to manage security and password rotation.\n\n## Solution: Securing cloud secrets with Secrets Hub\n\nSecrets Hub is a CyberArk SaaS solution that facilitates centralized control of secrets in one place.\n\nSecrets Hub acts as a trusted connector between cloud applications that run on cloud platforms (AWS or Microsoft Azure) and CyberArk Privilege Cloud. The secrets managed separately by multiple cloud platform applications are securely integrated with CyberArk Privilege Cloud.  \nThis integration enables your enterprise to securely manage its cloud  \nsecrets and enforce security policies on those secrets. As a unified  \ncentralized hub, Secrets Hub manages your enterprise secrets without  \naffecting developer velocity."
